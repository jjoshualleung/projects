I am a recent graduate in banking and finance at the University of London. I am studying data science and analytics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

In addition, I was a data analyst intern in a telecommunications company. Analyzing larger, diverse, noisy data sets and modeling systems in the cellular networking and localization domains. Used Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, GeoPandas, Folium, and Contextily in Python to perform analysis.
